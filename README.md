# Habit-Tracker
This Habit Tracker application, built in Kotlin, allows its users to monitor and eliminate any undesirable habits they might have. By being perfectly synchronized with Google Calendar, one can input reminders and tasks for oneself, making it easy to stay on track and be consistent with the establishment of one's habits. Basic habit tracking, visualization of one's progress, reminder of user preference, and gamification through streaks to keep a user motivated are the best features. This modern app comes with powerful performance to make self-enhancement and productivity an ease.
